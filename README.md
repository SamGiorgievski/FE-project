# UserFlow Dashboard - Full Stack Developer Portfolio Project

Welcome to my UserFlow Dashboard project! This project demonstrates my skills as a junior full stack developer, showcasing my ability to develop a React.js application UI that allows CRUD operations on user profiles based on a Figma design with additional features such as dark theme, pagination, sorting, and searching (with debounce) functionality.

## Project Overview

This project is a user dashboard that serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my proficiency in the following areas:

- Creating a RESTful app using Node.js, React, and Apollo GraphQL
- Styling with Material UI
- Handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Implementing dark and light theme.
- Pagination, sorting and searching functionality.

## Features

- **CRUD**: This API allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of user profiles using Apollo GraphQL
- **Data display**: MUI's table and pagination features to create a easy to use, customizable display.
- **Search**: I have used filters and a debounce function for smooth operation.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling to provide responses to clients in case of errors.

## Getting Started

This project was completed for an interview and they have blocked off their api. Currently the app cannot be used, but I have it on display to view the code.

## Technology Stack

- Node.js
- React
- Apollo Graphql
- Material UI
